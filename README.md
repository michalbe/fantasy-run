## History
Night is dark and full of terrors. You need to deliver ultra-secret message to the commander of the King's guard, before it will be too late. Like you ancestors after the battle of Marathon, you need to do your best and run. Your people depend on you.

## Setup
```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

## How?
  - Look left or right to dodge obstacles. Really, is that simple.
  - Your best distance is stored in `localstorage`.

## Assets
I used brilliant [`The Beast is out!` model set](https://sketchfab.com/models/8a142fb16e3147aaa4b07cce72dead34), rigged it and added animations in Blender.
