## Setup
```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

## How?
  - Look left or right to dodge obstacles. Really, is that simple.
  - Your best distance is stored in `localstorage`.

## Assets
I used brilliant [`The Beast is out!` model set](https://sketchfab.com/models/8a142fb16e3147aaa4b07cce72dead34), rigged it and added animations in Blender.
